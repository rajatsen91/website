abstract = "Deep generative networks can simulate from a complex target distribution, by minimizing a loss with respect to samples from that distribution. However, often we do not have direct access to our target distribution-our data may be subject to sample selection bias, or may be from a different but related distribution. We present methods based on importance weighting that can estimate the loss with respect to a target distribution, even if we cannot access that distribution directly, in a variety of settings. These estimators, which differentially weight the contribution of data to the loss function, offer both theoretical guarantees and impressive empirical performance."
