# Biography

I am a 5th year PhD. student in WNCG, UT Austin. I am advised by [Dr. Sanjay Shakkottai](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~shakkott/Sanjay_Shakkottai/Contact.html). During my time at UT Austin, I have also had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Alex Dimakis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/).

I received my Bachelors degree in ECE, IIT Kharagpur in 2013. I have spent most of my childhood in Durgapur and Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

Over the course of my PhD,  I have been lucky to work with excellent [collaborators](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YzsCLBoAAAAJ&hl=en) on a variety of problems in the areas of bandit problems [[A](https://rajatsen91.github.io/publication/stochexp/),[B](https://rajatsen91.github.io/publication/impband/),[C](https://rajatsen91.github.io/publication/latentcontextual/)], statistical testing [[A](https://rajatsen91.github.io/publication/modelpowered/),[B](https://rajatsen91.github.io/publication/detspon/),[C](https://rajatsen91.github.io/publication/mimic/)] black-box optimization with applications to hyper-parameter tuning [[A](https://rajatsen91.github.io/publication/mcts1/)], queuing systems with learnable parameters [[A](https://rajatsen91.github.io/publication/queregret/)] and GANs [[A](https://rajatsen91.github.io/publication/igan/)]. Here is my [resume](/pdf/rsenCV.pdf).

* <sup> <span style="color:blue">[News] </span> </sup> I am having a great time this summer as an applied scientist intern at A9 (Amazon) under the guidance of [Dr. Inderjit Dhillon](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/).
* <sup> <span style="color:blue">[News] </span> </sup> New [paper](https://rajatsen91.github.io/publication/mimic/) up on arxiv, where we propose a flexible frame-work for Conditional Independence testing which can make use of modern techniques like GANs and powerful regressors. 
* <sup> <span style="color:blue">[News] </span> </sup> New [paper](https://rajatsen91.github.io/publication/igan/) up on arxiv, where we show how to train a GAN that fits a distribution that is shifted from the training data. 
* <sup> <span style="color:blue">[News] </span> </sup> One [paper](http://localhost:1313/publication/mcts1/) accepted in ICML 2018, where we show how to perform multi-fidelity tree-search for hyper-parameter optimization.
