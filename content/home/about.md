# Biography

I am a 5th year PhD. student in WNCG, UT Austin. I am advised by [Dr. Sanjay Shakkottai](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~shakkott/Sanjay_Shakkottai/Contact.html). At UT Austin, I have also had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Alex Dimakis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/).

I received my Bachelors degree in ECE, IIT Kharagpur in 2013. I have spent most of my childhood in Durgapur and Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

My research interests include online learning (especially Multi-Armed Bandit problems), causality, learning in queueing systems, recommendation systems and social networks. I like to work on real-world problems that allow rigorous theoretical analysis.

Here is my [resume](/pdf/rsenCV.pdf).
